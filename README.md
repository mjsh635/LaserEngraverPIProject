# LaserEngraverPIProject
Repo for code used in the automation of my friends laser engraver power settings. He had ordered a unit that had a broken front display, so he couldn't use the buttons to set the correct values. After solding the outputs to the raspberry pi he was able to use the flask webpage to set and display the correct values.
